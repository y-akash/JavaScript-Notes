JavaScript
It's a single threaded programming language.
JS runtime can do one thing at a time.

What is V8
V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by the Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers.
WebAPI's {DOM, setTimeout, ajax, ....} => these are not in V8.

Me : What is JavaScript?
JS : Single threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.
I have call stack, an Event Loop, a callback queue, some other apis and stuff.
Me : Hey V8, do you have a call stack, an Event Loop, a callback queue, some other apis and stuff?
V8 : I have call stack & heap. WTF are those other thing.

To achieve Asynchronous callback we have CONCURRENCY & the EVENT LOOP

JS runtime can do one thing at a time so how ajax & asynchronous thing happenig?
the reason is browser, the browser gives us the othr thing i.e. webAPI's. these are effectivelyy a thread we can access like a thread.

example code => 1. console.log("Hi"); 2. AssyncCode; 3. console.log("Hello");

the above assyncCode is like we are requesting data from the server.
first line 1 comes in a stack and runs
than the second line comes but its asynchronous so it moves to WEBAPI's sections and wait for server response.
the 3 line come in a stack and runs now stack is empty.
when we get the response it directly not goes to stack bcoz it will come between the other stuff.
so it goes to TASK QUEUE after completion of WEBAPI's, after this EVENT LOOP comes into the picture.

EVENT LOOP
It look at the STACK and TASK QUEUE, if the STACK is empty than EVENT LOOP runs & it takes first thing from the TASK QUEUE & pushes on to the STACK & effectively runs it.
